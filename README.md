# Personal Portfolio

This is a basic portfolio site that I am going to be continuously adding to. It is very barebones for now but as I get more used to development in React, this portfolio will have extra features, sharper visuals, and more projects added.

**Link to project:** http://tbongiorno.github.io/tb-react-portfolio/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React

This is my first project using React and I didn't plan on having massive development cycles for this. I planned on learning React incrementally and adding to this project as I complete other projects and whenever I feel like it. I've already learned a lot about HTML and CSS from my previous Wishlist project, so this project is mostly devoted to React and JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned:

From this project, I have so far learned the very basics of React and how to build a publishible site using the framework.
